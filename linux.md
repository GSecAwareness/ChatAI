#### Now, let's install Linux using WSL and Docker. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature in Windows that allows you to run a full Linux environment directly within Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. This is especially useful for those who want to use Linux-based tools, such as Python or Bash, while keeping the Windows interface.

#### By removing the dependency on virtual machines, WSL reduces overhead, leading to better performance and lower memory usage. We’ll be using WSL 2, the latest version, which includes a full Linux kernel, greatly improving compatibility with Docker containers—an essential part of our setup moving forward. I chose to use Ubuntu because of its compatability and support with the Windows WSL service, but there are multiple options in the Microsoft store to choose from.
